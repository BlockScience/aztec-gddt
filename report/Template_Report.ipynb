    "\n",
    "A decision tree is a machine-learning-based classifier. Given the simulation results, for each threshold inequality the tree recursively associates different _samples_ from the results, according to sorting criteria based upon one or more of the protocol parameters of the simulation.\n",

    "Each decision tree below corresponds to one of the threshold inequalities stated above. Where the decision tree is 'empty', the threshold inequality was either 1) always fulfilled during the simulations, or 2) never fulfilled during the simulations. In this case no sensitivity analysis can be performed, as the threshold inequalities do not vary according to the different parameter combinations that were swept.\n",
    "\n",
    "The title of the decision tree includes the threshold inequality under scrutiny, in addition to a technical 'score' (usually \"100%\") and the number of simulation results used as the dataset. Within the decision tree presented, each **non-terminal** 'node' is labeled with the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The sorting variable used and its cutoff value used for classification, in the form of `parameter_name <= x` where `x` is the cutoff value. Branches to the left of this node indicate satisfaction of this inequality, while branches to the right indicate violations, i.e. `parameter_name > x`.\n",
    "2. A Gini coefficient representing the method of recursive association used.\n",
    "3. The total number of simulation results (\"samples = y%\") as a percentage \"y\" that are considered at this node.\n",
    "4. The breakdown of the simulation results considered into the left and right branches (\"value = [p, 1-p]\"), where \"p\" is the fraction of results that satisfy the `parameter_name = x` constraint, and \"1-p\" the fraction satisfying `parameter_name > x`.\n",
    "5. The classification of the majority of the simulation results at this node (note that this is not a final classification, as it appears in a non-terminal node, and can be arbitrary if the results are split equally across classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Terminal** nodes (\"leaves\") represent the final classification of that proportion of the simulation results that arrive at the node, and have most of the same information as a non-terminal node, with the exception that there is no branching performed and hence no sorting variable displayed. Here the most important information is the classification (last line). \n",
    "\n",
    "Non-terminal and terminal nodes colored in blue correspond to the threshold inequality being met, and by following blue boxes from a terminal node up to the root of tree a set of `parameter_name <= x` and/or `parameter_name > x` sorting criteria can be chained together. \n",
    "\n",
    "Upon successful classification, it is usual for the terminal node to have a breakdown \"value = [1.0, 0.0]\" or \"value = [0.0, 1.0]\", indicating that 100% of the remaining simulation results treated are either satisfying the threshold inequality under treatment (left value is 1.0), or not satisfying the threshold inequality (right value is 1.0).\n",

This leverages the use of \"random forests\", which is a technique to average over many different decision tree realizations over different subsets of the simulation results, assessing the relative contribution of each protocol parameter in the branching of each tree. Roughly speaking, the more times a protocol parameter was used in the branching process, the higher its importance is to the threshold inequality--in other words, the protocol parameter carries a larger 'weight' in determining satisfaction or violation of the inequality, and so the inequality is more sensitive to the values of the parameter.\n",

    "The simulation results provide, for each combination of swept protocol parameter values (\"parameter constellations\"), a series of outcomes distinguished by different random realizations of stochastic (\"Monte Carlo\") distributions. Thus, each of the KPIs can be computed for each simulation result, and a _frequency distribution_ or _density_ of KPI values can be generated for each of the iterations of the adaptive grid approach. These densities can be further broken down by protocol parameter value, and the changes in the densities across different values can be visualized. This provides a method of assessing the sensitivity of the KPIs to the protocol parameters, both at the initial adaptive grid implementation, before optimization is performed, and at the end of the implementation, when the recommended parameter ranges have been achieved.\n",
